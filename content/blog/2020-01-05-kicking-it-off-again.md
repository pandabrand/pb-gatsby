##This is it, again
New year, new blog. I'm trying this again.

Like so many people who get a little self-improvement focussed in the new year I have done the same. It's the same thing for the past few years, start a blog. I want to start writing and posting things outside of the gardens of social sites (you know the twitters and the instagrams, etc.). A place where I'm in control, sort of. This is also the time of year when I plan projects for the year and I think to myself I really need a place where I write with intention what I'm trying to work on. I need this for a couple reasons. One, accountability, if I start talking publicly about projects there's a little more incentive to actually finish them. Second, workflow, I really need to think about these projects in their smaller chunks and writing about those individual chunks helps me work those out.

For example this new blog, I started it out on a new framework [Gatsby by the way](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) to get some more React and GraphQL experience. Before I even set a git repo I was trying to figure out how I was going to solve the problem of posting from my phone because that was my number one problem from last year. Fortunately, I backed off that problem just to get this thing up and running. I'll be sure to let y'all know when I found a workflow for mobile posting that I can vibe with.

So, yes here we go again. Maybe this time it will stick. I'll leave you with the quote that makes me try again and again.

>Doubt increases with inaction.
